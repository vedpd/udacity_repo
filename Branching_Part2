-----------------Problem statement----------------------

## Your Turn

1. Create a new branch called `python_branch` and move to it.   Ans: git checkout -b "python_branch"
2. Create a `my_file.py` and add the following code to it:      ans: touch my_file.py
```
def add_values(a, b):                              ans : vi my_file.py.   . Press esc + i and edit and add the function, now, esc +:w(save) and 
                                                    then esc + :q (to quit editing window)
  return a+b
```
3. View the branches.  ans : git branch
4. Change back to the `main` or `master` branch.  ans: git checkout main
5. Create a new branch called `markdown_branch` and move to it.  ans : git checkout -b "markdown_branch"
6. Create a file called `new_file.md` and add the following:     ans : touch new_file.md
                                                                vi new_file.md   . Press esc + i and edit and add the markdown, now, esc +:w(save) and 
                                                               then esc + :q (to quit editing window)
```
This is a great markdown file!
```
7. View the branches. ans: git branch
8. Change back to the `main` or `master` branch.  ans: git checkout main
9. Now remove both branches.  ans: git branch -d markdown_branch (enter) 
                                   git branch -d python_branch


------------------------Solution--------------------------

Git commands used in this solution:

1. Create a new branch and move to it.
> git checkout -b 'branch_name'

2. List the created branches available on your local.
> git branch

3. Change between branches.
> git checkout branch_to_change_to

4. Delete branches.
> git branch -d branch_name_to_delete
Note: In order to delete a branch, you must first move off the branch you would like to delete.
