This repo is for the practice and regular assignments from Udacity MLOps nanodegree

Here are the commands towork on git:-
1. git clone "url_git_repo" : This command is used to clone a repository which publically accessible.

2. Post cloning : do check for the directory and then change the local directory to cloned directory.

3. Touch "file_name.extension" : To create a new file from terminal

4. Nano "filename" / vi "filename" : to edit the file. 
		    In case of vi ( type i to get into insert mode, press esc, 
		    then w to save it and q to quit) 

5. git add "filename" or git add * : to add files to git pipeline

6. git commit -m "comments" : this is to commit the files to the git repo.
		            Note: files have been added to separate branch created internally.
			    These files would need to get moved to main branch to appear on repo.

7. git push : This command would finally move the file which was committed to main branch

8. git status : This command helps to check if:-
		a. existing differences with cloned repo on local vs available online.
	        b. any non committed files
		c. if git commit has been done or not and file is showing in the git pipeline or not.
